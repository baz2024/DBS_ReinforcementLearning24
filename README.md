Reinforcement Learning 2024
=======================================

This module synthesises the principles and practices involved in the fundamental concepts of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical
material set off in shaded boxes. This module prepares learners with RL techniques and offers practical
insights into how this learning paradigm supports automatic mechanisms of structural knowledge
representation. It discusses a number of multilayer architectures giving rise to tangible and functionally
meaningful pieces of knowledge, and shows how the structural developments have become essential to
the successful delivery of competitive practical solutions to real-world problems.
