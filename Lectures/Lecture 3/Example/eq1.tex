The Monte Carlo method is a technique for estimating the value function in reinforcement learning. The equation for estimating the value of a state $s$ using the Monte Carlo method is given by:

\[
V(s) = \frac{1}{N(s)} \sum_{i=1}^{N(s)} G_i
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V(s)$ is the estimated value of state $s$,
    \item $N(s)$ is the number of times state $s$ has been visited,
    \item $G_i$ is the return (cumulative reward) from the $i$-th visit to state $s$,
    \item The sum is taken over all $N(s)$ visits to state $s$.
\end{itemize}

This equation represents the average of all returns observed from visits to state $s$, providing an estimate of its value based on empirical data.
