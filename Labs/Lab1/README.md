# Lab 1: Basics of Python for Scientific Computing

To review your knowldge of Python you can visist the following course:

[Python Crash-Course](https://fgnt.github.io/python_crashkurs/#/)

# Use jupyter notebook on own machine

The recommended way is to install jupyter notebooks through Anaconda:

[Install Anaconda instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Having installed anaconda, you should be able to start jupyter notebook servers with

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

# Use jupyter notebook on foreign machines/servers

If you find your own machine not performant enough for your needs, please consider one of the following options.

## Free options
* [Paperspace Gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/gradient)
* [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks)

## Paid options
